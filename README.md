# Summer-Olympics-
## 2nd assignment as a curriculum of 1 month Internship at Elite Techno Group .

I have uploaded 3 files i.e. Olympics.ipynb , olympics.py and Summer.csv

i have used Pandas ,Numpy and Matplotlib for cleaning ,procesing and graphically displaying/showing the required analysis of data respectively.

i tried to follow , very compact logic (i.e. using less number of lines) as possible.

### For Graphincal representation ,
-> I used 2 kinds of graphs : Bar and Barh 

-> various color combinations , such as gold 

-> and short descriptive labels for Graph axes 


I hope you would like my this Assignment.
and Feedbacks are really Welcomed!
